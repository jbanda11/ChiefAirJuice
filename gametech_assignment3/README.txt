HOW TO RUN AND CONNECT:

Build the project from gametech_assignment3/ with "./buildit"

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

FUNCTIONALITY/HOW TO PLAY:

* WASD to move around
* M1 to shoot balls
* In the bottom-right, you will see your own health.
* At the top, you will see the players also in the game and their healths.
* If you die, you will become a spectator. If someone else dies, they will disappear from your game.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NOTES:

* We support up to four players including the server probably, the more players, the laggier, so ideal gameplay is with 2 people.
* Sometimes some balls will not spawn, especially with more people, so keep trying.
* Do not try and kill players before everyone is ready.
* Once connected, anyone disconnecting is undefined behavior.

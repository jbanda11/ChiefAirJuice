ASSIGNMENT 3 PROJECT UPDATE

Call of Duty: But Bad
By Javier Banda, Mindy Chi, and Benjamin Johnson

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

We did well in terms of getting networking up and running with multiple-player support. It also feels like a real game with scoring using health, and end conditions. We would have liked to implement more things however-- like a scoring system for how many people you have dinked, and seeing top-scorers once the game is completed. Having a game session would have been nice too, with all players having to connect before starting the game and then knowing when the game is over. We would have liked to have a more intricate lobby, and prettier GUI with scores for everyone on it, but didn't have time as we were implementing main functionality. We didn't meet up as often as a group to work together and generally worked independently, which involved some wasted time trying to find the best way to do something or understand others' code to change it. Otherwise, we did well to get everything up and running.

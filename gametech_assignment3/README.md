By Javier Banda, Mindy Chi, and Benjamin Johnson

HOW TO RUN AND CONNECT:

Build the project from gametech_assignment3/ with "./buildit"

* If you would like to run as the server, then type "./ChiefAirJuice". Your **machine name** for other clients to connect to appears at the top of the game.
* If you would like to run as a client, then type "./ChiefAirJuice c" and type the **machine name** of the server to connect to in the box provided.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

FUNCTIONALITY/HOW TO PLAY:

* WASD to move around
* M1 to shoot balls
* In the bottom-right, you will see your own health.
* At the top, you will see the players also in the game and their healths.
* If you die, you will become a spectator. If someone else dies, they will disappear from your game.

NOTES:

* We support up to four players including the server probably, the more players, the laggier, so ideal gameplay is with 2 people.
* Sometimes some balls will not spawn, especially with more people, so keep trying.
* Do not try and kill players before everyone is ready.
* Once connected, anyone disconnecting is undefined behavior.

# MILESTONE 4.2

* We have implemented improvements to physics, new/better textures, and a new feature that allows you to implement the machine name rather than IP address
* We have yet to implement new game logic or UDP. Once the physics improvements are finalized (which are already in the works but won't make this milestone) we'll add powerups and obstacles. And once UDP is implemented we can implement cool optimizations such as client-side prediction, server-side reconciliation, among others.
* We're still on schedule: despite the largest tasks ahead of us, we'll weren't able to spend a lot of time on the project this week. Next week has less going on, so we'll be able to complete the tasks.

Javier worked on the textures and physics
Samuel created a few textures and implemented the new machine name feature
